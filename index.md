### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

Lab 1 was when we first learned to code, it was also one of my favorites. I had never coded before lab one, so it was an eye-opening experience, and I'm glad I signed up for this class. I also learned how to use std::cout in lab one which was very helpful as we use it in almost evry lab.  
    
* Lab 5

Another great lab was lab 5, where we learned how to calculate the area of a rectangle using calculations. Next, we use the user's input into the calculations to obtain the entire area. I am aware of what area is, but figuring out how to code it was a fun challenge that differed a lot from using a calculator. 

* Lab 6

Since blackjack is my favorite card game, lab 6, part 2 was my favorite since I was thrilled to code it. I gained knowledge on how to code the Aces' correct values. Overall, it was a positive experience and I wish we were taught how to code more card games as it was very intriguing.
